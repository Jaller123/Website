<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    Hello!
    My name is Kenath Liyanage and I am 23 years old from Sweden and just graduated to become a VR developer!
     
    I worked as a telemarketer and a chef before in my career and now want to be in the IT industry where I am more interested in VR, Front-end Development and UX.
     
    I have good skills in blender and have solid knowledge in Unity and also have experience in 3D modelling like Blender.
    
    I am always open to learn more and try other programs or coding languages.
     
    My goal as a Developer is to be able to learn different parts of the industry, broaden and improve my experience in IT and be able to work comfortably with other people.

    I've also made some projects that I want to showcase, feel free to check them out.
    </p>
